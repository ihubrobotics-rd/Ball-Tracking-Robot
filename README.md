## Ball Tracking Robot with Jetson Nano and Arduino 

This project builds a robot that tracks a yellow ball using a camera. Let's delve into its components, functionality, and step-by-step creation process.



**Hardware:**

* **Computation and Processing:**
    * Jetson Nano
    * MicroSD card (at least 16GB, recommended 32GB or higher for extended recording)
    * Power supply for Jetson Nano (refer to official specifications for voltage and amperage requirements)
* **Microcontroller:**
    * Arduino Uno or compatible board (e.g., Nano, Mega)
    * USB cable for programming the Arduino
* **Motor Driver:**
    * L298N motor driver module
* **Motors:**
    * Two DC motors (voltage and RPM dependant on your robot's design and desired speed)
* **Camera:**
    * USB camera or CSI camera module compatible with Jetson Nano
* **Sensors:**
    * Ultrasonic sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
* **Power Supply:**
    *  **New:**  A portable power bank (with sufficient capacity) to provide power in the field for the Jetson Nano, Arduino, and motors (consider voltage and current requirements of each component) 
* **Additional Components:**
    * Jumper wires for connecting components
    * Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)
    * Chassis or frame to build the robot
    * Wheels appropriate for the robot's size and weight
    * Screws, nuts, and mounting hardware (depending on your chassis design)
    * **New:**  Camera mount (depending on the camera chosen)
    * **New:**  Zip ties or fasteners for securing wires

**Software:**

* Jetson Nano Operating System (e.g., NVIDIA JetPack)
* Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for programming the Arduino
* OpenCV library (for computer vision on Jetson Nano)


**Functionality:**

1. **Video Capture and Processing:**
   * The Jetson Nano captures video using the camera.
   * OpenCV library processes frames to detect the yellow ball.
   * Ball's position and size are identified.

2. **Motor Control:**
   * Based on the ball's position, the Jetson sends commands to the Arduino.
   * Arduino adjusts motor speeds to ensure the robot follows the ball.

3. **Safety Stop:**
   * The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance to the ball.
   * If the distance falls below a safe threshold (e.g., 10 cm), the Arduino stops the motors to prevent a collision.

4. **Real-Time Visualization:**
   * The processed video displays the detected ball, providing visual feedback.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Setup and Configuration:**
   * Connect the camera to the Jetson Nano.
   * Connect motors, motor driver, and ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino.
   * Establish serial communication between Jetson Nano and Arduino.

2. **Jetson Nano Code:**
   * Initialize the camera and video capture.
   * Use OpenCV to detect the yellow ball in each video frame.
   * Calculate the error based on the ball's position relative to the center of the frame.
   * Send motor control commands to the Arduino based on the error.
   * Display the video with the detected ball highlighted.

3. **Arduino Code:**
   * Receive motor control commands from the Jetson Nano via serial communication.
   * Control motor speeds using PWM signals.
   * Continuously read the distance from the ultrasonic sensor.
   * Stop the motors if the distance to the ball is less than the predefined threshold.

4. **Testing and Calibration:**
   * Calibrate the camera and ultrasonic sensor for accurate detection and distance measurement.
   * Test the robot's responsiveness to the ball's movement.
   * Adjust the PID controller parameters for smooth and accurate tracking.

**Applications:**

* **Education:** Learn robotics, computer vision, and sensor integration.
* **Entertainment:** Interactive toy that follows a ball.
* **Prototyping:** Base platform for developing more advanced robots.

**Challenges and Considerations:**

* **Lighting Conditions:** Ball detection may vary with lighting. Proper setup is crucial.
* **Power Management:** A stable power supply ensures consistent performance.
* **Real-Time Processing:** Efficient video processing is needed for real-time responsiveness.
